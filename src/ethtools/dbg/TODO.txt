EXTRAS:
1 - Telescope command and automatic abi decoding for opcodes
2 - Display if we are taking next jump or not through emulation
3 - watchpoints on storage location or memory
4 - support for multiple transactions
5 - Modifying storage and memory on demand
6 - Visualize logs
7 - cache to avoid burn all the calls for Infura
8 - merge Yon's snapshots
9 - undo command
10- ui terminal
11- Support execution of TX from top of block, end, or specific position (more advanced)
    - Executing always at the top might not work in some cases (balance of tokens for a contract)
12- Decode strings if they look like strings when printing the disassembly or the stack
13- Custom gas for transactions
14- Order sstores and sloads temporarly (otherwise it's impossible to understand in which order this things happened)
15- Probably need this to support Avalanche:

16- Collect the pre-image and show them when there is an sstore on a map/array.
17- add dynamic provenance (use-def plugin printed with rich tree)
18- add code_address:storage_address for each log in the log_op
19- add break when opcode is X and its arguments are X,Y,Z.
20- add memory watchpoints

PRIORITY:
1- Avoid to re-execute all the txs to bring the EVM in the right state when replay (snapshot it?) (snapshot + checkpoint)
2- Documentation
3- Polishing!

BUGS:
0x53a9a0bbc478632da7c3a28883eb8e501708c136 does not compile due to import name non-sense

- ETHERSCAN should be optional 
- view source should be optional and just print a few lines 
- doc for view source 
- showroom for ethpwn 
- fix config in json
